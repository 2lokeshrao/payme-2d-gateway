### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

The repository is already initialized with Git. Now push it to GitHub:

```bash

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Commit Often**: Make small, focused commits
2. **Write Good Messages**: Clear, descriptive commit messages
3. **Use Branches**: Develop features in separate branches
4. **Review Code**: Review changes before merging
5. **Tag Releases**: Use semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)
6. **Update README**: Keep documentation current
7. **Respond to Issues**: Address user feedback promptly

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed

**Problem**: `remote: Invalid username or password`

**Solution**: Use Personal Access Token instead of password

### Permission Denied

**Problem**: `Permission denied (publickey)`

**Solution**: Check SSH key is added to GitHub

### Push Rejected

**Problem**: `Updates were rejected because the remote contains work`

**Solution**:
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

### Large Files

**Problem**: `file is too large`

**Solution**: Files over 100MB need Git LFS
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.large_file"
git add .gitattributes
```
